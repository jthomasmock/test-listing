## Readme

This is an experiment to recreate the core output from `connectwidgets` landing page.

Quarto has support for multiple listings, which generate bootstrap cards, grids, or tables, without a hard requirement for R.

In most situations it is ideal to generate the listing YAML files via a library like R's `yaml` or python's `PyYAML`. A dataframe, JSON, or list/dict can be converted into YAML via these packages, providing a path from API queries against RStudio Connect to generate local content and be converted into YAML listing fragments.
