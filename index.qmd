## `connectwidgets` without R

This document doesn't have any R code but recreates the core features of `connectwidgets` - providing a Python friendly way of creating custom aggregation pages!

Either `engine: python` or `engine: knitr` works for this document.
:::


## Background


This project illustrates using RStudio Connect to deploy a data science project featuring:

![](https://github.com/sol-eng/bike_predict/raw/main/img/arrows.drawio.png)

### Scheduled jobs
- Fetching and cleaning data from a continuously updating web source
- Pushing cleaned data to a relational database
- Creating intermediate datasets for subsequent use

### Pins
- Serving intermediate datasets and model objects for use in apps, APIs, and other jobs

### APIs / Vetiver
- Serving model predictions via HTTP requests deployed using vetiver

### Development and Production Apps
- Exposing model predictions to end-users through Shiny and Dash apps
- Using git-backed deployment to keep a stable version of the application available from the main branch while doing development work on another branch

### Private Packages
- Encapsulate re-usable logic in an R package, and distribute with Package Manager (see https://github.com/sol-eng/bikeHelpR)
